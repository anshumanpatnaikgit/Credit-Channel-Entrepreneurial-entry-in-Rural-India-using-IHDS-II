# Instrument Justification Framework

## I. Formal Loan Instrument

### A. The "Cultural Proximity" Channel
**(Direct Match with Bank Officers)**

Direct evidence that sharing a caste identity with a bank official leads to better loan access:

**1. Fisman, R., Paravisini, D., & Vig, V. (2017). *Cultural Proximity and Loan Outcomes*. American Economic Review.**

**Finding:**
This paper explicitly analyzes data from a state-owned bank in India. They find that when a borrower and a loan officer belong to the same caste or religion, the borrower is more likely to get a loan, receives a larger loan amount, and has lower collateral requirements.

**Mechanism:**
The authors argue this is due to better information. The loan officer can better evaluate the creditworthiness of someone from their own community ("soft information"), reducing the risk of lending.

### B. The "Information Diffusion" Channel
**(Navigating Bureaucracy)**

These papers argue that caste networks act as "information hubs," teaching members how to apply for loans, fill out forms, and approach banks.

**2. Munshi, K. (2011). *Strength in Numbers: Networks as a Solution to Occupational Traps*. Review of Economic Studies.**

**Finding:**
While focusing on occupational mobility, Munshi establishes that caste networks solve market imperfections (including credit constraints) by sharing resources and information.

**Application to Banks:**
If one member of a caste successfully navigates the formal banking system, this "how-to" knowledge (which forms to fill, who to talk to) diffuses rapidly through the network, lowering the entry cost for others.
